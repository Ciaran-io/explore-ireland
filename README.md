# milestone-project-2

This web application was built as part of my projects for Code Institude for full stack web developmet. The single application displays 3 areas in Ireland for cycling trails, tourist trails & hiking trails.
The application uses Google maps api as well as a email api to received messages from users. The google map will display 10 locations, when the user clicks on the map icons they will
see the trail location and county of the location. The email service utilzes email js and takes the users name, message & email. The email is then fowarded to a gmail account.
